# Karma Parcel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valotas/karma-parcel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valotas/karma-parcel)

Use [parcel][] to preprocess [karma][] tests

## Install

To get all the needed packages;

```
npm i karma parcel karma-parcel -D
```

## Configure:

Add `parcel` to the frameworks to be used and to the files that should be preprocessed with it:

```js
module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
    frameworks: ["mocha", "parcel"],

    // add patterns with all your tests even if they should not
    // be handled by parcel
    files: ["tests/**/*.js",
    {
      // parcel tests should not be watched. Parcel will do the
      // watching instead
      pattern: "parcel/**/*.js",
      watched: false,
      included: false
    }]

    // let karma know which of the test files should be bundled
    // with parcel
    preprocessors: {
      "parcel/*": ["parcel"]
    }
  });
};
```

## Under the hood

Parcel will create one bundle will all the files that are preprocessed with
the `parcel` preprocessor. The preprocessor will emit an empty file instead of
the actual content. The plugin will register the bundle file to karma's
fileList with `serve: false` in order not to be handled by karma's middleware.
To serve the bundled file, parcel's own middleware is registered and used
